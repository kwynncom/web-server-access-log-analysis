        <h1>user agents - what is the point of all this?</h1>
        
        <p>Every request to a web server such as kwynn.com generates a line in the web server access log.  A "user agent" is a part of that line that self-identifies the 
            browser or robot making the request, such as <br/><br/>
            Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 9; SM-S367VL) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.92 Mobile Safari/537.36
        </p>
        
        <p>In part because I fell compelled to do (many) things myself, I have spent lots of time digging around kwynn.com's logs trying to find useful information.  
            (This is a case of data mining or data science and Big Data techniques on a small data set.)  My first question is how many lines / hits / requests 
            self-identify as bots.  Today's answer is 79%, which is close enough to previous estimates.  After that, I am trying to figure out how many human beings 
            read my site, and how engaged they are.
        </p>
        
        <p>I could discuss this endlessly, but I'll move this along for now.
        </p>
        
        <section>
        <h2>a whole line</h2>
        
        <p>A whole line looks like this:
            
        </p>
        
        <div>66.249.64.199 - - [12/Dec/2021:16:37:53 -0500] 861050 "GET /t/21/09/no_vax_work.html HTTP/1.1" 200 649 "-" 
            "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 6.0.1; Nexus 5X Build/MMB29P) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.93 Mobile Safari/537.36 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)"
        </div>
        
        <p>The 66.249... is the IP address of the client (in this case, the GoogleBot) making the request.  More specifically, it is an internet protocol version 4, 32 bit 
            address.  There are also IPv6 128 bit addresses.  Generally, publishing an IP address is one of a small number of items I would not want to publish.  However, 
            if you look up the "whois" information on that address, you'll see that it traces to Google.  I don't think the GoogleBot needs its privacy.  
        </p>
        
        <p>The first '-' is a non-existence username for when you're using the Apache web server as a user manager, which is pretty much never done anymore, if it ever 
            was done.  I don't remember what the other '-' is; I'll link to the documentation below.
            
        </p>
        
        <p>Then the date and 861050 is the number of microseconds after that date.  I added microseconds in that it's non-standard.  
            
        </p>
        
        <p>"GET" refers to the HTTP GET method / command.  Simple requests--without form data--are usually GETs.  Then there is the URL relative to kwynn.com root 
            (DocumentRoot), or <a href='https://kwynn.com/t/21/09/no_vax_work.html'>https://kwynn.com/t/21/09/no_vax_work.html</a>.  (Actually, nothing in my log indicates 
            http versus https.)  
         </p>
         <p>"200" indicates an HTTP response code of "200 OK"--the web server found the data and is returning it: no errors.  649 is the number of bytes returned with 
             compression, usually gzip.  
         </p>
         
         <p>The next '-' means no referrer.  A referrer can be a PNG request showing that the request came from the "parent" page (an internal referral), or that the 
             Google search engine referred the user as the result of a search (external referral).  
             
         </p>
         
         <p>Then there is the user agent.  I have shown you enough of those for you to come to your own conclusions.

            <h2>Q&A</h2>
            
            <p>One of my apprentices asked some questions about this:</p>
            
            <p>He asked about various issues around identifying humans versus bots.  
                I link to <a href='https://github.com/kwynncom/web-server-access-log-analysis/blob/c17b69191465c8fa7ec4a0204b391ddf5761cc79/agents_sa/bots.php'>my 
                    current bot test</a>.  Assuming it is accurate, it shows at least 79% bots.
