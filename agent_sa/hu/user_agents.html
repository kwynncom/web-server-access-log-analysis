    <h1>"user agents" - explanation, source code, etc.</h1>
    
    <p>Sometimes a "user agent" is a detailed description of a browser and usually OS and hardware details, such as</p>
    <pre>Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/81.0.4044.129 Safari/537.36</pre>
    
    <p>Sometimes it's a browser, but more generally the user agent is identification of what sort of software is accessing a site. 
        The user agent is one of several pieces of data in web server access logs.   </p>
    
    <p>Every client / browser request of every file is entered into a web server access log such as /var/log/apache2/access.log in the case of the 
        Apache web server running on Linux.  It's entered as one line of data.  That includes fetches (HTTP GETs) of favicons, JavaScript files, CSS files, 
        images, etc.  Each of those files is a separate line.  
        
    </p>
    
    <p>As you see from "the data," linked at the top, 73% of requests as I write this are from robots that say they are robots.  Robots as in web spiders, crawlers, 
        scrapers, etc.  In 2021, I can be almost certain that "MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1" is also a bot, but I want to look at those lines before I figure out 
        how to deal with such cases.  The fact that the count for that agent is surrounded by bots in sort order is obviously one big hint.  The fact that 
        the version of MSIE is ancient is another.  Satan's Operating System versions in user agents are weird, so I don't know what to make of "NT 5.1" without 
        looking it up.  You'll note that modern versions are closer to "NT 10.0," however.
