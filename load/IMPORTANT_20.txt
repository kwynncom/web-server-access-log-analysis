Upon 3rd review, maybe there is a buffering issue.  If I tried to print everything in the database, it ate up RAM in Robo3T.  
Would the shell shell be any different?

As for the following, or maybe not.  I may have simply been low on RAM.  Things were might faster when I shut everything unnecessary down.

It would appear that the Mongo shell buffers output before it even starts.
That is, with a .forEach(... print ...) the printing doesn't start to happen for 10 - 15 seconds.  
Would Node.js help?  What else can be done?
